### 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?  
Effective cost control ensures a project stays within budget, avoiding financial strain.   

Strategies include detailed budgeting, regular cost tracking, managing scope changes, and efficient resource allocation.

### 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
#### Agile: 
* Flexible, iterative, and adaptive;   
* allows for changes based on feedback.  

Disadvantages include potential scope creep and less predictability  

#### Waterfall: 
* Linear, structured, and easier to manage; 
* good for well-defined projects.  

Disadvantages include inflexibility to changes and late testing.

### 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
#### Agile: 
Beneficial for projects with evolving requirements, such as software development. Example: a startup developing a new app. 
#### Waterfall: 
Beneficial for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, such as building construction. Example: a government infrastructure project.

### 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods include code reviews, automated testing, continuous integration, and user feedback.  

Maintaining high standards is crucial for delivering reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software.

### 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope clarifies objectives and deliverables, aiding in accurate planning.  

A Work Breakdown Structure breaks down the project into manageable tasks, helping with organization and tracking.

### 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps manage time, resources, and dependencies.  

Gantt charts visually represent tasks, timelines, and progress, facilitating tracking and adjustments.

### 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?



### 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem ensures the solution addresses the correct needs, avoids scope creep, and focuses development efforts on delivering real value.

### 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?


### 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?


### 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
